### Project Completion: 34.5%

1. ### Project Setup & Dev Environment

[x] Initialize Git repo, branches for frontend, backend, blockchain
[x] Setup Supabase project (auth, database for off-chain storage)
[] Setup ICP/DFINITY dev environment with Motoko tooling
[x] Create React app skeleton with shared styling (color palette/fonts)

2. Supabase Backend & API

[x] Define and create tables: users, sessions, transcripts metadata (off-chain storage)
[x] Implement API endpoints for user management, session creation
[] Implement endpoints for storing and fetching encrypted transcript data
[x] Integrate authentication with Supabase (patients & doctors)

3. ICP Motoko Smart Contracts: Blockchain Core

[] Design data model for blockchain (hashes, audit logs, consent records)
[] Develop Motoko smart contracts for:
[] Storing transcript hashes + timestamps
[] Storing audit trail events (access, updates)
[] Managing patient consent permissions
[] Deploy initial smart contracts on ICP local or testnet

4. Frontend: Patient Web App (Login + Session Start)

[x] Create login/register UI linked to Supabase auth
[x] Implement session start UI (button to initiate chat/call)
[] Hook session start to backend & blockchain (store session start event on-chain)

5. Frontend: Doctor Dashboard Base

[x] Build dashboard layout and routing
[x] Show patient list (from Supabase) with basic info
[x] Placeholder for transcripts & call logs UI

6. LLM Integration (Chat Assistant)

[x] Choose and set up LLM (Huggingface or OpenAI API)
[x] Build backend or frontend service to handle conversational prompts
[x] Connect chat input to LLM and display AI responses

7. STT & TTS Integration (ElevenLabs or Whisper)

[x] Implement speech-to-text transcription service and frontend audio capture
[x] Implement text-to-speech playback of AI responses
[x] Integrate audio + chat UI for seamless voice interaction

8. Real-time Transcript & Sentiment Analysis

[] Stream transcriptions to backend for sentiment analysis (using LLM or separate model)
[] Store encrypted transcripts off-chain (Supabase)
[] Generate hash of encrypted transcripts and send to blockchain smart contract for immutability
[] Display sentiment analysis on frontend in real-time

9. Doctor Dashboard: Transcript & Audit Trail

[] Fetch and display transcripts with sentiment highlights
[] Query blockchain for audit logs related to patient sessions
[] Display audit trail (access, consent updates) in dashboard
[] Add UI to manage patient consent stored on blockchain

10. Email Follow-up System

[] Design follow-up email templates with secure session links
[] Schedule and automate emails using Supabase functions or external service
[] Link emails to patient sessions and blockchain audit logs for traceability

11. Blockchain Enhancements & Testing

[] Add smart contract functions for consent revocation and audit querying
[] Write test scripts for Motoko contracts (unit & integration)
[] Simulate real user flows and check blockchain event accuracy

12. UI Polishing & Responsiveness

[] Refine styles, loading states, error messages
[] Ensure accessibility and mobile-friendly UI
[] Polish doctor dashboard and patient web app UX

13. Deployment & Demo Preparation

[] Deploy frontend (Vercel/Netlify) and backend (Supabase, ICP)
[] Setup environment variables and keys securely
[] Run end-to-end tests
[] Prepare demo walkthrough and documentation
